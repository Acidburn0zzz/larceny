This directory holds compatibility files for hosting under plt-r5rs,
the r5rs-compatible language provided by PLT Scheme v4.

To select these compatibility files when setting up the Larceny build
environment, use 'plt-r5rs as the 'scheme: argument to the setup
procedure in setup.sch.

----

These compatibilty files have also been used with DrScheme v372 when
using the "Standard (R5RS)" language level.

Note that these compatility files do not work when invoking PLT Scheme
via the mzscheme application.

----

This compatibility layer has been explicitly designed to be a thin
veneer over the Compat/MzScheme/ compatibility layer.  The only one of
any real interest, compat.sch, uses PLT's special #%require form to
import several non-R5RS procedures into the top-level environment;
after all anticipated dependencies have been satisified, the file
dispatches to load the Compat/MzScheme/compat.sch file.

There are a number of other files in here, but they all immediately
load their counterparts in Compat/MzScheme.

----

The main disadvantage of this design is that changes to
Compat/MzScheme/ code could necessitate changes to
Compat/PLT-R5RS/compat.sch (or elsewhere).  The main advantage is
conceptual simplicity for this compatibility layer.
