Building Larceny
6 November 2006

WHAT YOU NEED

If you want to recompile the Scheme sources entirely from
source, you will need a Scheme system to host the Larceny
build process: either MzScheme 209 or Larceny itself [1].
See README-FIRST.txt for more details.

If you want to build Larceny or Petit Larceny entirely from
source, you will also need a C compiler (such as gcc).  For
x86-32 targets, you will also need the nasm assembler [2].


WHAT TO DO

Building Larceny has three major steps:

1. Get the Larceny development environment working.

Run your host Scheme (either another Larceny or MzScheme 209), and
change to the root directory of the Larceny tree.

    > (load "setup.sch")
    > (setup 'scheme: ${SCHEME} 'host: ${HOST} [ 'native | 'nasm | 'sassy ])
    > (build-config-files)              ; [3]
    > (load-compiler)

The call to setup (above) has several options that let you
declare which implementation of Scheme you want to use for
the build process (SCHEME) and which OS you are using as
both the host and target of the build (HOST):

        SCHEME ::= 'mzscheme | 'larceny | 'petite | 'chez
        HOST   ::= 'macosx | 'solaris | 'linux86 | 'win32

Additionally, the optional 'native flag will build native Larceny
(SPARC) on Solaris; 'sassy will build native Larceny (x86-32) on
Linux or Windows; and 'nasm will build the now-deprecated
Petit/nasm Larceny (x86-32) using the NASM backend instead of
Sassy.

The 'sassy or 'nasm flag is necessary if you want to use dynamic
loading on Win32, and is strongly recommended for that operating
system.  There are several other optional flags that change the
compiler's behavior [4].

Some useful examples which are known to work:
                                                         ; to build:
    > (setup 'scheme: 'larceny  'host: 'solaris 'native) ; native Larceny
    > (setup 'scheme: 'mzscheme 'host: 'win32 'sassy)    ; native Larceny
    > (setup 'scheme: 'larceny  'host: 'linux86 'sassy)  ; native Larceny
    > (setup 'scheme: 'larceny  'host: 'linux86 'nasm)   ; deprecated
    > (setup 'scheme: 'mzscheme 'host: 'linux86)         ; Petit Larceny
    > (setup 'scheme: 'larceny  'host: 'solaris)         ; Petit Larceny
    > (setup 'scheme: 'mzscheme 'host: 'macosx)          ; Petit Larceny


2. Build Larceny components

After the development environment is setup, you should compile the core
system:

    > (build-heap)
    > (build-runtime)
    > (build-executable)

You will now have a working Larceny interpreter and minimal heap image.

To build a complete Larceny user system, including the Twobit compiler:

    > (build-larceny-files)

On Petit, you may want to build the Twobit compiler development
environment:

    > (build-twobit)



3. Create heap images

Step 2 above creates a bootstrap heap (petit.heap, sparc.heap, or
sasstrap.heap).  To create the user and development heap images, exit
the host Scheme back to your command shell.

On Native Larceny (SPARC):

    % ./larceny.bin -stopcopy -- src/Build/sparc-larceny-heap.sch
    > (exit)

    % ./larceny.bin -stopcopy -- src/Build/sparc-twobit-heap.sch
    > (exit)
    % cp larceny twobit

On IAssassin Larceny (Intel) [5]:

    % "./larceny.bin" -stopcopy -- src/Build/iasn-larceny-heap.sch
    > (exit)

    % "./larceny.bin" -stopcopy -- src/Build/iasn-twobit-heap.sch
    > (exit)
    % cp larceny twobit

On Petit Larceny:

    % ./petit-larceny.bin -stopcopy
    > (load "setup.sch")
    > (setup [ 'nasm ])
    > (load-compiler)
    > (load "src/Build/petit-larceny-heap.sch")
    > (exit)

    % ./twobit.bin -stopcopy -- src/Build/petit-twobit-heap.sch
    > (dump [ 'nasm ])
    > (exit)

You can now run ./twobit, ./larceny, or ./petit-larceny.


NOTES

[1] For the build process, we recommend using a prebuilt version
of Larceny itself.  You can also use MzScheme 209; MzScheme 3xx
will be supported in a later release.  Use (Petite) Chez at your
own risk.  In the past, several other implementations of Scheme
could be used for the build process, but they haven't been tested
lately and aren't likely to work any more.

[2] http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm

For Petit/NASM (Win32), Microsoft's development tools and NASM must
both be in your search path.

[3] This is only strictly necessary the first time and when the options
given to setup have changed, but it should be safe to do every time.

[4] Some other potentially useful flags, given optionally at the end of
the call to setup:

    'code-cov
        This enables loading of the instrumented files generated by the
        stcov tool when loading the compiler. Use this to test code
        coverage of the compiler testsuite

    'rebuild-code-cov
        This causes the stcov files to be regenerated before loading.
        This implies 'code-cov.

    'always-source
        Don't load compiled fasl files when loading the development
        environment under Larceny.  This is useful under Petit Larceny
        if the executable gets out of sync with the fasl files.

[5] The quotation marks around "./larceny.bin" are a uniform syntax that
works on both Microsoft Windows and UNIX-like shells.  The reason is
left as an exercise for the reader.
