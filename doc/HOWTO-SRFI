SRFI Support


SRFIs, which are Scheme Requests for Implementation, are
specifications of libraries that have been designed by
Scheme programmers for Scheme programmers.  The SRFI
project is open to anyone; see http://srfi.schemers.org

Larceny currently supports many SRFIs, though not as many
as it should.  Some SRFIs are built into Larceny, but
most of the supported SRFIs must be loaded dynamically
using Larceny's require procedure, as in

    > (require 'srfi-0)
    > (require 'srfi-1)

Implementations of the SRFIs that Larceny supports via
the require procedure can be found in lib/SRFI.

If you need a SRFI that Larceny doesn't yet support,
please let us know.
