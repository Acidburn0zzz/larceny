Lexical syntax
--------------

Larceny is now case-sensitive by default.
This is controlled by Larceny's `case-sensitive?` parameter,
which is affected by the following flags:


    #!r6rs
    #!r5rs
    #!err5rs
    #!larceny
    #!fold-case
    #!no-fold-case


For the detailed semantics of these flags, please consult
the Larceny developers' web page that describes
http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/larceny-trac/wiki/LexicalConversion[Larceny's
lexical syntax].

Apart from case-sensitivity, Larceny extends both R5RS lexical
syntax and the lexical syntax proposed by the
http://www.r6rs.org/[R6RS].
The R6RS does not permit extensions, however, so Larceny
provides several mechanisms for turning its extensions on and
off.
For details, please consult the web page cited above.
