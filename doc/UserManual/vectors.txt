_Procedure vector-copy_


++ (vector-copy _vector_) => _vector_++

     Returns a shallow copy of its argument. 

_Operations on vector-like structures_


++ (vector-like? _object_) => _boolean_  ++

++ (vector-like-length _vector-like_) => _fixnum_  ++

++ (vector-like-ref _vector-like k_) => _object_  ++

++ (vector-like-set! _vector-like k object_) => _unspecified_++

A vector-like structure is a low-level representation on which data
that are indexable like vectors are built, e.g., vectors, structures,
symbols, and ports.

There is no way of constructing a "generic" vector-like structure; use
the constructors for the data types mapped onto vector-like structures
instead, like make-vector.

The vector-like operations operate on all vector-like structures. All
the procedures are integrable.
