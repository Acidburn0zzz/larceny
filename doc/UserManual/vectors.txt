_Operations on vector-like structures_

A vector-like structure is a low-level representation on which data
that are indexable like vectors are built, e.g., vectors, structures,
symbols, and ports.

There is no way of constructing a "generic" vector-like structure; use
the constructors for the data types mapped onto vector-like structures
instead, like make-vector.

The vector-like operations operate on all vector-like structures. All
the procedures are integrable.
