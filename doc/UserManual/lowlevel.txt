_Procedure current-continuation-structure_


++ (current-continuation-structure)++

Returns a transparent representation of the current continuation: a
vector representing the innermost continuation frame. A field in the
frame points to the parent frame, and so on.

_Procedure make-trampoline_

++ (make-trampoline _procedure_)++

Returns an environment-less procedure that takes any number of
arguments and tail-calls _procedure_ with those arguments.

It is not possible to create a procedure with a shorter procedure
structure than that of a trampoline. That fact may be relied on: a
trampoline can be patched into any other procedure.

_Procedure peek-bytes_

++ (peek-bytes _address buffer k_)++

Read _k_ bytes from memory starting at address _address_ and placing
them in the bytevector _buffer_ starting at index 0.

_Procedure poke-bytes_

++ (poke-bytes _address buffer k_)++

Write _k_ bytes from bytevector _buffer_ starting at index 0 to memory
starting at address _address_.

_Procedure syscall_

++ (syscall _code obj1 ..._)++

Make a call on the Larceny run-time system function identified by
_code_ with arguments obj1 .... Returns what is returned by the system
function.
