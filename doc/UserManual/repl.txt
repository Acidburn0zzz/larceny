anchor:repl[]

The Read-Eval-Print Loop ("REPL")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Parameter repl-level_

The value of this parameter is a nonnegative exact integer that is the
current nesting level of read-eval-print loops.

_Parameter repl-evaluator_

The value of repl-evaluator is a procedure of two arguments, an
expression and an environment. The procedure should evaluate the
expression in the environment and return the result(s).

_Parameter repl-printer_

The value of repl-printer is a procedure of two arguments, a value to
print and a port.

If the value to print is not #!unspecified, the procedure should print
it on the current output port. The default printer is write in
r5rs.heap and pretty-print in larceny.heap and twobit.heap.

_Parameter repl-prompt_

The value of repl-prompt is a procedure that takes two arguments, a
level and an output port, and that prints a prompt corresponding to
that level on the port.

_Parameter herald_

The value of herald is a string or #f. If a string, the
read-eval-print loop prints the string when Larceny first starts up.

    repl behavior in general, notably 
      - its control of current input and output and how you can't interactively
        change current input and output.
      - its control of the error handler, reset handler, quit handler, and 
        sundry interrupt handlers
