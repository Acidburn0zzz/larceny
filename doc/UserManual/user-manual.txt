Larceny User Manual
===================
Larceny Developers <larceny@ccs.neu.edu>

Larceny provides all of the required and most optional parts of Scheme
as described in the
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/R4RS/r4rs_toc.html[Revised^4^ Report],
the <<IeeeStd, IEEE Standard>>,
and the
http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_toc.html[Revised^5^ Report].

Larceny also provides some of the features that have been proposed
in drafts of the http://www.r6rs.org/[Revised^6^ Report].
That report will become Larceny's primary documentation of these
features.

This manual describes those aspects of Larceny that are not described
by the Revised Reports or by the IEEE standard.
It also contains a temporary chapter that explains which features of the
draft http://www.r6rs.org/[R6RS] are currently implemented by Larceny.
