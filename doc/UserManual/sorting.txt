Sorting

_Procedures sort and sort!_

++ (sort _list less?_) => _list_ ++

++ (sort _vector less?_) => _vector_ ++

++ (sort! _list less?_) => _list_ ++

++ (sort! _vector less?_) => _vector_++

These procedures sort their argument (a list or a vector) according to
the predicate _less?_, which must implement a total order on the
elements in the data structures that are sorted.

Sort returns a fresh data structure containing the sorted data; sort!
sorts the data structure in-place.
