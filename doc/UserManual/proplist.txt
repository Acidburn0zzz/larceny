Property Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _property list_ of a symbol is an association list that is
attached to that symbol. The association list maps _properties_, which
are themselves symbols, to arbitrary values.

_Procedure putprop_


++ (putprop _symbol_ _property_ _obj_) => _unspecified_++

If an association exists for _property_ on the property list of
_symbol_, then its value is replaced by the new value
_obj_. Otherwise, a new association is added to the property list of
_symbol_ that associates _property_ with _obj_.

_Procedure getprop_

++ (getprop _symbol_ _property_) => _obj_++

If an association exists for _property_ on the property list of
_symbol_, then its value is returned. Otherwise, #f is returned.

_Procedure remprop_

++ (remprop _symbol_ _property_) => _unspecified_++

If an association exists for _property_ on the property list of
_symbol_, then that association is removed. Otherwise, this is a
no-op.
