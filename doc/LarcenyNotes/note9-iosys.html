<h2>The I/O architecture</h2>

<p>
Larceny's I/O system is strongly influenced by
the Modula-3 I/O system presented
in Greg Nelson's book, <em>Systems Programming in Modula-3</em>.  The
I/O system is designed with performance and user-extensibity in mind.
</p>

<p>
Larceny's I/O system is composed of several layers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I/O facilities provided by the underlying operating system</li>
<li>syscalls that make a slightly OS-dependent abstraction of
    certain low-level I/O operations available to Scheme</li>
<li>Scheme code that constructs an OS-independent abstraction
    of certain low-level I/O operations</li>
<li>the <a href="#ioproc"><code>ioproc</code> layer</a>,
    which implements an
    abstraction of binary input and output</li>
<li>the <a href="#iosys"><code>iosys</code> layer</a>,
    which implements buffering,
    transcoding, and end-of-line handling</li>
<li><a href="#specialized">specialized</a> and
    <a href="#custom">custom</a> ports of the R6RS io system</li>
<li>R5RS and R6RS io systems</li>
</ul>

<!-- p>
See <tt>Lib/iosys.sch</tt>, <tt>Lib/fileio.sch</tt>, <tt>Lib/conio.sch</tt>,
<tt>Lib/stdio.sch</tt>, and (for the low-level stuff) <tt>Lib/unix.sch</tt>.
</p -->

<h2>
<a name="lowlevel">
Low-level operations
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Larceny translates some of the basic I/O operations provided
by the underlying operating system into a small set of
OS-independent operations that open, close, read, and write
a slight abstraction of low-level file and console ports.
This abstraction is implemented by the following files:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/Rts/Sys/syscall.c</code></li>
<li><code>src/Rts/Sys/osdep-generic.c</code></li>
<li><code>src/Rts/Sys/osdep-unix.c</code></li>
<li><code>src/Rts/Sys/osdep-macos.c</code></li>
<li><code>src/Rts/Sys/osdep-win32.c</code></li>
<li><code>src/Lib/Common/sys-unix.sch</code></li>
<li><code>src/Lib/Common/sys-macos.sch</code></li>
<li><code>src/Lib/Common/sys-win32.sch</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="ioproc">
The <code>ioproc</code> layer
</a>
</h2>

<p>
At the <code>ioproc</code> layer, a port is implemented
using a Scheme procedure of one argument:
a symbol that denotes the operation to perform.
After dispatching on that symbol, the ioproc procedure
returns a port-specific procedure that, when called,
performs the operation.  The operations are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>read : iodata * buffer &rarr; { fixnum, 'eof, 'error }</code></li>
<li><code>write : iodata * buffer * count &rarr; { 'ok, 'error }</code></li>
<li><code>close : iodata &rarr; { 'ok, 'error }</code></li>
<li><code>name : iodata &rarr; string</code></li>
<li><code>set-position! : iodata * posn &rarr; { 'ok, 'error }</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>read</code> operation, which attempts to fill the
given input buffer, is supported only for input ports;
the <code>write</code> operation, which empties the given
output buffer, is supported only for output ports; and the
<code>set-position!</code> operation is supported only for
ports that support <code>set-port-position!</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>iodata</code> argument to an <code>ioproc</code>
represents any additional state that may be associated with
a port but encoded separately from the port's ioproc and its
methods.  There is no standard representation for the
<code>iodata</code> object; its nature and interpretation
vary from one kind of port to another.
</p>



<h2>
<a name="iosys">
The <code>iosys</code> layer
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The <code>iosys</code> layer implements Scheme ports.
Each port is an object that encapsulates:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an <code>ioproc</code></li>
<li>any <code>iodata</code> needed by the <code>ioproc</code></li>
<li>buffers</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thread-aware I/O</h2>

<p>
To support thread-aware I/O, we need two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Mutual exclusion in access to the I/O structures.</li>
<li> Blocking I/O that is compatible with the threads system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mutual exclusion is not hard; the procedures in <tt>Lib/stdio.sch</tt>
can be wrapped in a <tt>without-interrupts</tt> form.  The lock should
probably be a public part of the port structure so that it's possible 
for (system) code to acquire it once and then call low-level primitives
for better performance.
</p>

<p>
Since the threads system is (currently) written in Scheme on top of
continuation, blocking system calls are no good.  Instead, I/O system
calls that may block indefinitely must be avoided.
</p>

<p>
The right thing to do seems to consider two subtypes of I/O ports, along
the lines of the Modula-3 I/O system.  A port is classified either as
<em>intermittent</em> or not.  Intermittent ports may have to wait an
unbounded amount of time before input is available or output is accepted.
Currently, the only intermittent ports are console I/O ports, but when
the extensible I/O system goes public, we'll have sockets pretty quickly.
</p>

<p>
Intermittent ports havs the following unique attribute: the underlying
read and write methods return <tt>would-block</tt> if no work was
accomplished (no input was ready or no output would be accepted).  If
that token is returned to the fill or flush methods, then the operation
on the port must block until the port is ready.  This blocking can be
done either by polling or by interrupts.  If I/O interrupts are available,
then the I/O system must enable them and set up an I/O event handler.
If not, the I/O system must register an I/O poll procedure for the port
as a periodic system task.  In either event, the I/O system will then
block the thread on a condition variable that will be signalled by the
ready handler, whichever method is used.
</p>

<p>
I think that the actual underlying mechanism chosen for unblocking
threads can and should be independent of the Scheme I/O system.  This is
possible if the I/O system supports an installable "ioblock" handler
that it will call to wait for I/O on a port.  System code will then
install the correct ioblock handler for the I/O event system chosen on
the particular platform.
