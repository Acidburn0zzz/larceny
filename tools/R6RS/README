This directory contains a subdirectory, rnrs, in which I am
creating/collecting R7RS implementations of some R6RS standard
libraries for use by R7RS libraries and programs.

Some of these implementations will be incomplete, but partial
implementations may be more useful than none at all.

List of R6RS standard libraries and their current status:

(rnrs base)                     not yet implemented
(rnrs unicode)                  partially implemented atop (scheme char);
                                still missing:
                                    string-normalize-nfd
                                    string-normalize-nfkd
                                    string-normalize-nfc
