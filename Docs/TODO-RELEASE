Release 2 todo and check lists

Working on:

 * Implement pointer transformation for non-aligning compilers.
   Works for USE_GOTOS_LOCALLY+RETURN_WITH_VALUE, not otherwise tested.
   Need to test:
     - other jump disciplines
     - other C compilers than mingw
     - that twobit.exe works as it should (it does, with mingw)

 * Bug: DLL loader code (in Lib/Standard-C/loadable.sch) does not
   properly adjust the code pointer.  One problem is that it is not
   known to that code whether the code pointer has to be adjusted or
   not!


Things That Must Be Done (tm) aka Significant Usability Bugs (r)

 * BUG: -stats does not seem to do anything.

 * Quality: Online help not quite right for Petit Larceny

 * Quality: Instances of OPTIMIZEME in Rts/Standard-C/petit-instr.h.  

 * Quality: Get rid of Auxlib/ altogether.  Stuff that must be available
   for twobit goes into Lib; the rest moves to the external library.
   Note, this affects std-heap.sch, especially.

 * For most people it is most reasonable that Twobit share the macro
   definitions between the interpreter and compiler, so that loading
   a file with macros in the interpreter is reflected when the compiler
   is invoked.  This does not work now.  Fix it!

 * Better dynamic loading of compiled code: as it is, a given file
   can only be loaded once, so if foo.fasl points to foo.so and
   foo.so is regenerated, then (a) if the old version is overwritten
   we crash, and (b) even if we don't crash the loader will refuse to
   load a file with the same name again.  So either (a) give the
   object files consecutive names (.1.so, .2.so, ...) or (b) store
   the object code in the FASL file (in a bytevector) and dump it 
   into /tmp and load it from there when loading the FASL.  Gambit
   does the former, it requires being able to inspect the directory.
   The latter solves the silly LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem and makes
   FASL files easily moveable.

 * Make the debugger work with both x86-NASM and Petit, and make sure
   debug info is emitted correctly.  Information is probably missing
   for internal procedures.  See Larceny note #12 and 
   Lib/Common/procinfo.sch.

 * SRFI: The most important non-supported SRFIs are the exception
   and condition SRFIs.  It would be very nice to have these.

 * FFI: Test well on Win32 -- does it work according to the docs?
   (Could look like copy-qword is broken, it does not update esi
   the way copy-dword does?)

 * FFI: Test well on Linux -- does it work according to the docs?

 * FFI: Does the docs reflect how it works?  (I observe that the
   README in the Ffi/ directory does not know about the 386
   implementation.)

 * SRFI: I am using COND-EXPAND to load SRFIs but this is sort
   of bogus, cf recent discussion on SRFI-0 list.  Should probably
   fix this both in SRFI code as well as in test code.

 * Performance: It may be important for truly good code generation to
   generate completely dense switches for dispatch in a procedure --
   no gap between the start label 0 and normal label, and no dead
   labels.)

 * Win32: FIXMEs in the Win32 support code (osdep-win32); nothing important,
   mostly version number / time measurement.

 * Win32: Synchronous interrupts are disabled because longjmp out of
   signal handler does not work on WinNT or Win2K; it would be nice to
   fix this (or some blocking syscalls will not be interruptible).

 * Win32: Make it work under the MinGW shell "MSYS", looks like there could
   be an I/O flushing issue in the generic-io package that needs to be
   fixed.

 * Probably get rid of support for compiling Larceny from other Scheme
   systems.


Lower priority:

 * Quality: the HOWTO documentation needs to be HTML, it is becoming
   increasingly cross-referenced.


QA:

  * Go over all docs to make sure they are at least mostly relevant
