Release 2 todo and check lists


Things That Must Be Done (tm) aka Significant Usability Bugs (r)

 * For most people it is most reasonable that Twobit share the macro
   definitions between the interpreter and compiler, so that loading
   a file with macros in the interpreter is reflected when the compiler
   is invoked.  This does not work now.  Fix it!

 * SRFI: The most important non-supported SRFIs are the exception
   and condition SRFIs.  It would be very nice to have these.

 * FFI: Test well on Win32 and Linux, make sure it works and that the
   documentation reflects how it works.

 * Test peephole optimization in Petit Larceny, and when it
   appears to work, turn it on by default.  Consider backporting
   eg GLOBAL/INVOKE from the x86-nasm version.

 * Figure out how to emit #defines into the generated C and ASM
   for compiler switches that effect the macros, like unsafe-code
   and inline-allocation.

 * Make work under Win32 with Cygwin or MinGW.

 * Implement pointer transformation for non-aligning compilers,
   to work properly under Win32 with Codewarrior and MSVC.

 * Better dynamic loading of compiled code: as it is, a given file
   can only be loaded once, so if foo.fasl points to foo.so and
   foo.so is regenerated, then (a) if the old version is overwritten
   we crash, and (b) even if we don't crash the loader will refuse to
   load a file with the same name again.  So either (a) give the
   object files consecutive names (.1.so, .2.so, ...) or (b) store
   the object code in the FASL file (in a bytevector) and dump it 
   into /tmp and load it from there when loading the FASL.  Gambit
   does the former, it requires being able to inspect the directory.
   The latter solves the silly LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem and makes
   FASL files easily moveable.

 * Update documentation to reflect the actual state of the system

 * X86-NASM: Finish up the exception handling millicode.  Make sure 
   it can at least rebuild itself and run the test suites, we can
   put off more optimization and call it 'alpha'.

 * Make the debugger work with both x86-NASM and Petit, and make sure
   debug info is emitted correctly.  Information is probably missing
   for internal procedures.  See Larceny note #12 and 
   Lib/Common/procinfo.sch.

 * The require system must play nice with heap dumping: the database
   must not be unconditionally reinitialized even if .larceny reloads
   the REQUIRE package.  (Implemented, not yet tested.)

 * The make system seems broken: a lot of stuff that should never be
   recompiled for make-petit-heap is anyway recompiled.  Why?

 * SRFI: I am using COND-EXPAND to load SRFIs but this is sort
   of bogus, cf recent discussion on SRFI-0 list.  Should probably
   fix this both in SRFI code as well as in test code.

 * Merge Util/petit-macosx.sch into Util/petit-unix-be.sch,
   ditto for any configuration stuff in Util/configurations.
   Change doc'n as appropriate.

  Test heap dumping everywhere?

  Package libraries and scripts so that it is convenient to
  build apps without having a source tree available?
