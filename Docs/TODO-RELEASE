Release 2 todo and check lists

Working on:

 * Implement pointer transformation for non-aligning compilers.
   Works for USE_GOTOS_LOCALLY+RETURN_WITH_VALUE, not otherwise tested.
   Need to test:
     - other jump disciplines
     - other C compilers than mingw


Things That Must Be Done (tm) aka Significant Usability Bugs (r)

 * Figure out how to package Petit Larceny: something akin to
   std-heap.sch and r5rs-heap.sch.

 * For most people it is most reasonable that Twobit share the macro
   definitions between the interpreter and compiler, so that loading
   a file with macros in the interpreter is reflected when the compiler
   is invoked.  This does not work now.  Fix it!

 * Better dynamic loading of compiled code: as it is, a given file
   can only be loaded once, so if foo.fasl points to foo.so and
   foo.so is regenerated, then (a) if the old version is overwritten
   we crash, and (b) even if we don't crash the loader will refuse to
   load a file with the same name again.  So either (a) give the
   object files consecutive names (.1.so, .2.so, ...) or (b) store
   the object code in the FASL file (in a bytevector) and dump it 
   into /tmp and load it from there when loading the FASL.  Gambit
   does the former, it requires being able to inspect the directory.
   The latter solves the silly LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem and makes
   FASL files easily moveable.

 * Make the debugger work with both x86-NASM and Petit, and make sure
   debug info is emitted correctly.  Information is probably missing
   for internal procedures.  See Larceny note #12 and 
   Lib/Common/procinfo.sch.

 * Quality: Instances of OPTIMIZEME in Rts/Standard-C/petit-instr.h.  

 * Quality: Get rid of Auxlib/ altogether.  Stuff that must be available
   for twobit goes into Lib; the rest moves to the external library.
   Note, this affects std-heap.sch, especially.

 * SRFI: The most important non-supported SRFIs are the exception
   and condition SRFIs.  It would be very nice to have these.

 * SRFI: I am using COND-EXPAND to load SRFIs but this is sort
   of bogus, cf recent discussion on SRFI-0 list.  Should probably
   fix this both in SRFI code as well as in test code.

 * FFI: Test well on Win32 -- does it work according to the docs?
   (Could look like copy-qword is broken, it does not update esi
   the way copy-dword does?)

 * FFI: Test well on Linux -- does it work according to the docs?

 * FFI: Does the docs reflect how it works?  (I observe that the
   README in the Ffi/ directory does not know about the 386
   implementation.)

 * Cleanup: Probably get rid of support for compiling Larceny from
   other Scheme systems.

 * MacOS X TO-DO items: see section at the end of HOWTO-MACOSX.

 * Win32 TO-DO items: see section at the end of HOWTO-WIN32.

 * LIB: The require system must play nice with heap dumping: the
   database must not be unconditionally reinitialized even if .larceny
   reloads the REQUIRE package.  (Implemented, not yet tested.)

 * Quality: Honor defines like INLINE_ALLOCATION more generally in the
   code generation macros.  (Implemented in x86-nasm, not in Standard-C.)

 * Quality: the HOWTO documentation needs to be HTML, it is becoming
   increasingly cross-referenced.

 * Performance: It may be important for truly good code generation to
   generate completely dense switches for dispatch in a procedure --
   no gap between the start label 0 and normal label, and no dead
   labels.)


QA:

  * Go over all docs to make sure they are at least mostly relevant
