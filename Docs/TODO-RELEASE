Release 2 todo and check lists


Working on:

 * Quality: Instances of OPTIMIZEME in Rts/Standard-C/petit-instr.h.  


Things That Must Be Done (tm) aka Significant Usability Bugs (r)

 * For most people it is most reasonable that Twobit share the macro
   definitions between the interpreter and compiler, so that loading
   a file with macros in the interpreter is reflected when the compiler
   is invoked.  This does not work now.  Fix it!

 * Better dynamic loading of compiled code: as it is, a given file
   can only be loaded once, so if foo.fasl points to foo.so and
   foo.so is regenerated, then (a) if the old version is overwritten
   we crash, and (b) even if we don't crash the loader will refuse to
   load a file with the same name again.  So either (a) give the
   object files consecutive names (.1.so, .2.so, ...) or (b) store
   the object code in the FASL file (in a bytevector) and dump it 
   into /tmp and load it from there when loading the FASL.  Gambit
   does the former, it requires being able to inspect the directory.
   The latter solves the silly LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem and makes
   FASL files easily moveable.

 * Make the debugger work with both x86-NASM and Petit, and make sure
   debug info is emitted correctly.  Information is probably missing
   for internal procedures.  See Larceny note #12 and 
   Lib/Common/procinfo.sch.

 * SRFI: The most important non-supported SRFIs are the exception
   and condition SRFIs.  It would be very nice to have these.

 * FFI: Test well on Win32 -- does it work according to the docs?

 * FFI: Test well on Linux -- does it work according to the docs?

 * FFI: Does the docs reflect how it works?

 * Make Petit Larceny build under Win32 with Cygwin or MinGW.

 * Implement pointer transformation for non-aligning compilers,
   to work properly under Win32 with Codewarrior and MSVC.

 * Update all documentation to reflect the actual state of the system

 * SRFI: I am using COND-EXPAND to load SRFIs but this is sort
   of bogus, cf recent discussion on SRFI-0 list.  Should probably
   fix this both in SRFI code as well as in test code.

 * Worry about situations where a build configuration escapes to the
   'net with the source? flag set to #t, this will confuse people that
   read the instructions for compiling Twobit.

 * Quality: Clean up the Util/petit-win32.sch; the unix variants are
   much cleaner.
