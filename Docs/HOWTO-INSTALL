Installing Larceny
April 2006 / tov+pnkfelix

Short version:  Copy the startup script(s) to wherever you like, and
then edit it to set LARCENY_ROOT to wherever the Larceny tree is
installed.


Long version:

After you download a binary distribution of Larceny or build from
source, there will be several scripts for starting Larceny in the root
of the Larceny tree.  These can be run from that location, regardless of
where you keep the tree.  If you want to make Larceny available to other
users of your system, however, or if you want to install the executables
in a standard place, this document will tell you how.

Larceny is usually started by a script, which has two functions:

 - It sets an environment variable LARCENY_ROOT to the absolute path of
   the Larceny tree, which is assumed to be the same as the directory
   that the script is in.

 - It dispatches on the name of the script, to choose both a Larceny
   executable (such as twobit.bin) and a heap image (such as
   petit.heap).

Which scripts you have depends on what platform you are using:

 - Windows: Batch files "petit.bat" and "twobit.bat"
 - SPARC Native Larceny: Shell scripts "larceny" and "larceny-r5rs"
 - Petit Larceny: Shell scripts "petit" and "twobit"

If you would like to move one of these scripts to another directory but
not rename it, it is sufficient to hard-code the location of the Larceny
tree in the script.  For example, to install Petit Larceny into
/usr/local on Linux, untar the Larceny tree as /usr/local/lib/larceny.
Then, copy the scripts "petit" and "twobit" to /usr/local/bin, and edit
each one by uncommenting the line that sets LARCENY_ROOT, and setting it
to /usr/local/lib/larceny.

If you would like to change something else, such as the name of one of
the scripts, editing the script should not be too difficult.
