Larceny v0.38:  CVS tag is release-0-38.  I meant to include further
CVS info for you in this message but I'm extremely tired and need to
leave soon.

Important notes: 

  - You _must_ define a procedure $$trace in MacScheme's compatibility
    libraries because the macro expander files now call this procedure --
    this is used for debugging and is normally invisible.
	(define ($$trace x) #t)
    is adequate.

Bugs fixed:

  - As previously reported.

  - Several important bugs in the BUGS file.

  - Bug reported by you:

    >... but the last two uses of STRING->SYMBOL in
    >Compiler/prefs.sch are buggy.  This bug will show up for lambda
    >expressions that have at least 29 required arguments and also have a
    >rest argument.  The fix is to move the definitions of name:CAR and
    >name:CDR from Compiler/prefs.sch to Compiler/sparc.imp.sch, and to
    >change those definitions to use the correct system names for CAR and
    >CDR.  It appears that there are no existing system names for CAR and
    >CDR, which means we'll have to invent some (probably .car and .cdr)
    >and also add those names to $usual-integrable-procedures$.

Bugs remaining:

 - Even though interpreter uses new macro expander, the syntax environment
   has not been integrated with top-level environments in even the most
   rudimentary manner, hence we're not R5RS compliant.  This is at the top
   of my list.

 - Several important bugs in BUGS.

 - Procedure names are still not nearly good enough, consider something as
   simple as `remv'.

 - Interpreter should use documentation from macro expander for its own
   documentation.

 - FFI remains unfixed and untested.

 - Documentation still lacking.

 - There still unix-dependent path names in Lib/makefile.sch; if you use
   this with MacScheme, then you're still in trouble.  This can be fixed
   w/o too much trouble.
