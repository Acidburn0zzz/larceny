This is to announce Larceny version 0.37 (11 December).  The system is
still somewhat in flux, but improving.  Documentation is lagging behind
the changes in this file, but improving also.


Source code
-----------

Use CVS (in a clean directory) to get the sources.  The CVS tag is
'release-0-37', so

	cvs checkout -d larceny-0.37 larceny_src

should do the trick.

In a pinch, grab my snapshot: /proj/will/lth/releases/larceny-0.37-src.tar.gz.


Some features included
----------------------
* Hygienic macro expander in the compiler (not yet in the interpreter).
* Many, many bug fixes (especially in generic arithmetic).
* Transcript ports.  Larceny now has _all_ optional and required parts 
  of R4RS, R5RS, and the IEEE/ANSI Standard.


Some features missing
---------------------
* The new macro expander does not preserve procedure names, so debugging
  can be hard.
* Constant folding / constant propagation is not included, so code is
  larger and slower than it will eventually be.


Important changes
-----------------
As we're moving towards release, things are getting cleaned up and
hopefully named in a more consistent manner.  The changes below are
a consequence of this effort.

The 'nbuild' script is now called 'build'.

Names names of command line switches to 'build' have changed, for 
  reasons of consistency with other changes.  Importantly, there is
  a switch '-help' that will print a useful help message.

The scripts 'Rts/config' and 'Rts/expand-mac' no longer exist but
  have been folded into 'build'.

The default Scheme system used by 'build' is now a program called 'larceny',
  which must be in your path somewhere.  The default program used to be 
  Chez Scheme.  If you do not have a working program called 'larceny' in 
  your path, you are well advised to change the definition of BUILD_HOST 
  in 'build' to 'chez' until you do.

The Larceny executable is called 'larceny.bin' and you must use this
  name as an argument to 'make'.

The Larceny heap expected by 'larceny.bin' is called 'sparc.heap', not
  'larceny.heap' as before.

The procedure 'make-larceny-heap' in the development environment has
  been renamed 'make-sparc-heap'.

The Lib directory now has subdirectories: Common, Sparc, Standard-C.

The obsolete names 'repl-eval-procedure' and 'repl-display-procedure' have
  been removed from the top-level namespace; use 'repl-evaluator' and
  'repl-printer' instead.

The now-useless procedure 'twobit-auxiliary-expander' has been removed,
  and no support for an auxiliary macro expander is currently provided.

There is a directory Scripts that contain two shell scripts, 'larceny' and
  'twobit'.  These can be installed and edited as described in the manual's
  intro page.

The manual has an intro page:
  See the new page: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lth/manual/intro.html.

There are scripts Util/std-heap.sch and Util/twobit-heap.sch to build
  standard heap images.  Their use is described in the "Compiling and
  Installing Larceny" section of the manual:
