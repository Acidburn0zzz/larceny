Twobit and Larceny v1.0 alpha 1 are now available.

Twobit is a retargetable optimizing compiler for Scheme, and Larceny
is an implementation of Scheme that uses Twobit to generate native
code for the SPARC architecture under SunOS 4 and SunOS 5 (Solaris).
Larceny provides a choice between four garbage collectors: two
generational collectors, a nongenerational stop-and-copy collector,
and the Boehm/Weiser conservative collector.

Source code and binary distributions are available, under liberal
redistribution terms.

See http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/Larceny/index.html for details.
