Garbage collection times
------------------------
Ephemeral collection, Sparc IPC, 0.99 MB live data, empty transaction list:
  456 ms

Tenuring Collection, Sparc IPC, 0.99 MB live data:
  526 ms

(Note: The times include profiling overhead. The only non-literal data type
       in the heap at the time of collection is the continuation frame (a
       vector). Each frame is 5 words long, plus one word of padding.)

(Note: Times averaged over 5 runs, and based on output from 'gprof'. Times
       do not include stack flush time, merely raw collection time.)


Memory Bandwidth
----------------
Memory Bandwidth, Sparc IPC, hand-coded, copying doublewords:
  130 ms / 1 MB.

Memory Bandwidth, Sparc IPC, compiled, copying words:
  180 ms / 1 MB (sun's standard 'cc' with "-O4 -dalign")
  280 ms / 1 MB (GNU cc v 1.39 with "-O -fstrength-reduce")

(Note: Sun 'cc' produces code that which is cache-conscious and also unrolls
       the loop a fair bit, neither of which is done by 'gcc'. This explains
       the large difference in times. In this respect the latter is probably
       more realistic, since copy bounds are not fixed during a garbage
       collection.)
