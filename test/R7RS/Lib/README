This directory contains an R7RS test suite obtained by modifying
Racket's R6RS test suite.  Racket's R6RS test suite is covered by
the LGPL, so this derivative work is also covered by the LGPL.
See README2 for more information on copyright and licensing.

Matthew Flatt wrote most of Racket's R6RS test suite, and Will
Clinger rewrote that test suite as necessary for R7RS.  There
have been other contributors as well.

------------------------- An R7RS Test Suite -------------------------

======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================

It should be possible to run the test suite in any implementation of
R7RS (small) that provides the standard libraries (scheme base) and
(scheme write) and implements R7RS include and cond-expand correctly.
Tests of unavailable libraries and unsupported number syntax will be
bypassed using cond-expand and include.

======================================================================
Files and libraries
======================================================================

The "testall-larceny" shell script runs all tests in Larceny, with
console output duplicated into a file named "testresults".  To run
the tests in other systems, edit a suitably named copy of that file
(or just use the system to run the "run.sps" program).

Files that end with ".sps" are R7RS programs. The "run.sps" program
runs all the tests. Programs that test just one library can be found
in the "tests/scheme/run" directory.

Files that end with ".sld" are R7RS libraries. For example,
"base.sld" is a library that implements `(tests scheme base)', which
is a set of tests for `(scheme base)'. Many R7RS implementations
will auto-load these ".sld" files if you tell them to search the
"tests" subdirectory (or its parent directory "tests/..").

For each `(scheme <id>)' library described by the R7RS (small)
standard:

 * There's a library of tests named "tests/scheme/<id>.sld". It
   defines and exports a procedure named `run-<id>-tests'.

 * There may be a file named "tests/scheme/<id>.body.scm".  If it
   exists, it contains source code to be included by "<id>.sld".

 * There's also a program "tests/scheme/run/<id>.sps" that imports
   `(tests scheme <id>)', runs the exported `run-<id>-tests'
   procedure, and reports the results.

And then there's 

 * "tests/scheme/run.sps", which runs all the tests (as noted above)

 * "tests/scheme/run-via-eval.sps", which is similar to "run.ss" but
   runs each set of tests via `eval'

 * "tests/scheme/test.sld", containing `(tests scheme test)', which
   implements the testing utilities used by all the other libraries

 * "tests/schemecontrib.sld" and "tests/scheme/run/contrib.sps",
   which implement and run contributed tests; these tests might be
   contributed when someone finds a bug in an implementation that
   seems worth testing in other implementations; also, they may be
   difficult to pin to a particular R7RS library; finally, they may
   use extra libraries from the "contrib" sub-directory

======================================================================
Limitations and feedback
======================================================================

The test suite tries to cover all of the bindings of R7RS, and tries
to check a variety of uses.

One goal of this test suite is to avoid using `eval' (except when
specifically testing `eval'). Avoiding `eval' makes the test suite as
useful as possible to ahead-of-time compilers that implement `eval'
with a separate interpreter. A drawback of the current approach,
however, is that if an R7RS implementation doesn't supply one binding
or does not support a bit of syntax used by a set of tests, then the
whole set of tests fails to load.

A related problem is that each set of tests is placed into one
function that runs all the tests. This format creates a block of code
that is much larger than in a typical program, which might give some
compilers trouble.

In any case, reports of bugs (in the tests) and new tests would be
very much appreciated. Please send bug reports and new tests to
larceny@ccs.neu.edu.
