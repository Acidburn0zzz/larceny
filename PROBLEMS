PROBLEMS GETTING THE NEW TWOBIT UP AND RUNNING.


Chez version 4.x does not have values and call-with-values. These have been
defined in compat.ss, but that is not compatible (!) with Chez v5.x; there 
needs to be different versions of compat.ss for the different versions,
selectable when things are set up (can autodetect).

E.g.
	echo '(exit)' | scheme | head -1 | awk '{ print $4 }'

--------------------

Compiler assumed existence of toplevel procedure %list; however, that
procedure was only defined by the REPL code, so code which required
it before the REPL was loaded would not work (as was the case of the
printer, called before the repl was loaded).

--------------------

Segmentation fault occured during gc when bellerophon was present but
not when it was absent (possibly related to the problem of the undefined
%list, although that should have been caught by an undef-global
check...)
