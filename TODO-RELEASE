We will release the SPARC back-end only for the first release.
The version of the first release will be 1.0-alpha1.

The following items are _important_ to fix or include for the first
release.  The complete to-do list (file ${LARCENY}/TODO) is much longer.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[General tasks]
 - Release party plans!
   * Where & when
   * What to eat
   * What to play with

[Bugs] (Not all of these deserve to be fixed)
  * Bignum->flonum bug.
  * Integrate-usual-procedures and (+ x x x x).
  * Procedure-names are not good enough.
  * Need inline procedures and constant folding for fixnum operations.
  * 'Case' really ought to do better when the constants are fixnums,
    currently it just expands to a call to memv.
  * Some sort of help facility (esp. for compiler switches and compilation
    commands) would be useful in larceny.heap.  The standard help file
    is not appropriate because many of the procedures it mentions are not
    available in larceny.heap.
  * FFI procedures are not hidden in larceny.heap.  (Moot point since
    FFI will not be included in 1.0a1.)
  * (Issue-warnings #t) should be the default.

[FFI]
  * Sundry bugs must be fixed (see the TODO file).
    - How to load e.g. the file socket-support.o that has unresolved
      external references?
    - Test (better) on SunOS 5.
    - Test on SunOS 4.
    - Write guidelines for compiling C code for use with FFI.
    - Should exit if errors are discovered in the relinking phase.
    - Document!
    - larceny_call() must deal with stack overflow.
  * Testing.

[User/reference documentation]
  * Compilation documentation
      compiling.html                 [cleaned up, not proofread]
      starting.html
      repl.html
      developing.html
      bdw.html

[Testing]
  * Decide on test procedure for release builds.
  * Test cases:
    (and (unsafe-code) (write-barrier))             ; fast, generational
    (and (not (unsafe-code)) (write-barrier))       ; safe, generational
    (and (unsafe-code) (not (write-barrier)))       ; fast, stop+copy
    (and (not (unsafe-code)) (not (write-barrier))) ; safe, stop+copy

[Release]
  * At release time: change home page.
  * Version number -> 1.0a1
  * Release procedure.
    - make sure switch settings in Util/init-comp.sch are right.
    - decide what's needed in a release, create shell script to strip or
      extract.
    - make sure to do ( cd Rts; BUILD_HOST=chez make config ) before making 
      the archive.
