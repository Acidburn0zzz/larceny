We will release the SPARC back-end only for the first release.
The version of the first release will be 1.0-alpha1.

The following items are _important_ to fix or include for the first
release.  The complete to-do list (file ${LARCENY}/TODO) is much longer.


[General tasks]
 - Copyright on pretty printer   [Followup II sent to Marc around 12/2.]
 - Investigate stop+copy collector: larceny -stats and display-memstats
   only report one heap area, even with a split heap.  There should be
   two!  Either this is a bug in the reporting code or there's an RTS bug.

[New version of Twobit]
  * Hygienic macros.
    - In compiler.            [done]
    - In interpreter.
      - Use macro expander
      - Grab source code from macro expanded expression to use for
        debug info.
    - In environments, somehow.
  * Must react to include-procedure-name, etc.
  * I don't understand why load-environment complains about every1? 
    being unavailable -- it's available in COMPILER and should not be
    needed anywhere else.  Why does the name appear in the interaction
    environment?  Who places it there?  It just seems to appear after
    COMPILER has been loaded (see 'check' in load-env.sch).

[Debugger]
  * Interpreted procedures have two pieces of code: the procedure and
    the expression.  Exploit this fact (the debugger handles this
    currently, if the interpreter sets things up right).

[SPARC assembler]
  * Fixnum-only arithmetic
    - optimize fx+ and fx- when it's possible to undo.
    - macro expander modifications (multi-argument, constant folding)
    - more testing, but looks OK.

[FFI]
  * Sundry bugs must be fixed (see the TODO file).
    - How to load e.g. the file socket-support.o that has unresolved
      external references?
    - Test (better) on SunOS 5.
    - Test on SunOS 4.
    - Write guidelines for compiling C code for use with FFI.
    - Should exit if errors are discovered in the relinking phase.
    - Document!
    - larceny_call() must deal with stack overflow.
  * Testing.

[User/reference documentation]
  * Compilation documentation
      compiling.html                 [cleaned up, not proofread]
      starting.html
      repl.html
      developing.html
      bdw.html

[Testing]
  * Test cases:
    (and (unsafe-code) (write-barrier))             ; fast, generational
    (and (not (unsafe-code)) (write-barrier))       ; safe, generational
    (and (unsafe-code) (not (write-barrier)))       ; fast, stop+copy
    (and (not (unsafe-code)) (not (write-barrier))) ; safe, stop+copy

[Bugs]
  * Fix all BUGS with medium or high priority.

[Misc]
  * Must update compiler help file with new switches, change from
    make-larceny-heap to make-sparc-heap.
  * Further use of nbuild-files in Lib/makefile.sch.
  * At release time: change home page.
  * Release procedure.
    - decide what's needed in a release, create shell script to strip or
      extract.
    - decide on test procedures.
    - make sure to do ( cd Rts; BUILD_HOST=chez make config ) before making 
      the archive.


If time permits (it won't)
--------------------------

[To-do]
 - A graph printer is highly desirable for including source code in compiled
   files -- the unpreprocessed source code as emitted to the heap image
   takes over twice the space of the fully-commented, fully-indented source 
   files.  That's not adequate.

[Testing]
  * Clean up test suite in general -- include programs from the
    test directory, and clean them up.
  * Create Larceny Note about how to run tests.

[Run-time system]  [Lars]
  * Support heap dumping with generational GC.

[SPARC assembler]
  * The code for op2imm generates slow code for some primitives: it emits 
    the constant into SECOND and then does a non-imm operation.  It gets
    + and - right; it would be nice to get =, <, <=, >, >= also, although
    the savings is one (static or dynamic) instruction, and the peephole
    optimizer gets most of the cases -- it's only where the datum is in
    RESULT and the result is being left in RESULT where this optimization
    matters.  Payoffs are slightly better for char=?, etc, since it's 
    costly to generate a character constant (2 instructions).  Still
    I expect most operations to work on operands in register, so the
    peephole optimizer will take care of it.
  * Fixnum-only arithmetic -- see Asm/Sparc/sparcprim-part4.sch.
    Remaining tasks:
      - fxquotient, fxremainder

  * Peephole optimizations
      Unimplemented peephole operations
        bytevector operations
          bytevector-length
          bytevector-ref          (also op2imm)
          bytevector-set!
          bytevector-like-length
          bytevector-like-ref     (also op2imm)
          bytevector-like-set!
        vector-like operations
          vector-like-length
          vector-like-ref         (also op2imm)
          vector-like-set!
        others
          char->integer
          integer->char
          logand logior logxor lognot sll srl sra

   - Implement const/setreg/skip peephole optimization for simple constants
     and any target register -- allows the delay slot of the branch to be
     filled.

[Dev. env]
  * Would be possible to just have one procedure 'make-larceny-heap' that
    would build for the correct target.  This would be a real improvement.
