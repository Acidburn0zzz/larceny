AUXILIARY LIBRARIES
-------------------

Larceny comes with many auxiliary functions which are not part of the
basic heap image. These are located in the Auxlib subdirectory. You can
load them all into a running system by compiling to .fasl all the Scheme
files in the Auxlib library (sorry, no automation yet) and loading the
file "Auxlib/auxload.sch"; it will in turn load all these
files. Typically you load this file from your .larceny file.

Libraries included are:

	sort.sch	- sort and sort!, works on lists and vectors
	pp.sch		- pretty-printer
	misc.sch	- useful non-standard library procedures
	load.sch	- a fancy extended-functionality 'load' procedure
