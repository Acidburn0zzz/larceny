Release Notes


1 Compiler settings

The default compiler settings in larceny.heap are 

	(fast-safe-code)
	(benchmark-mode #f)

Thus, the programmer promises not to redefine the procedures
in the following list:

	* + - -- / < <= = > >= abs assoc assq assv break
	bytevector-fill! bytevector-length bytevector-like-length
	bytevector-like-ref bytevector-like-set! bytevector-like?
	bytevector-ref bytevector-set! bytevector? caar cadddr caddr
	cadr car cdar cddddr cdddr cddr cdr char->integer char<=?
	char<? char=? char>=? char>? char? complex? compnum? cons
	creg creg-set! disable-interrupts enable-interrupts
	eof-object eof-object? eq? equal? eqv? exact->inexact
	exact? fixnum? flonum? for-each fx* fx+ fx- fx-- fx< fx<=
	fx= fx> fx>= fxnegative? fxpositive? fxzero? gc-counter
	imag-part inexact->exact inexact? integer->char integer?
	length list logand logior lognot logxor lsh make-bytevector
	make-procedure make-string make-vector map member memq memv
	most-negative-fixnum most-positive-fixnum negative? not
	null? number? pair? port? positive? procedure-length
	procedure-ref procedure-set! procedure? quotient rational?
	real-part real? remainder rot round rsha rshl set-car!
	set-cdr! string-length string-ref string-set! string?
	structure? symbol? sys$bvlcmp sys$partial-list->vector
	sys$read-char truncate typetag typetag-set! undefined
	unspecified vector vector-length vector-like-length
	vector-like-ref vector-like-set! vector-like? vector-ref
	vector-set! vector? zero?

It is possible to configure the compiler to treat only a subset of these
names as having known values by editing Compiler/sparc.imp.sch.

The programmer can allow primitives to be redefined by calling
(standard-code); usually this results in a loss of performance.
