Larceny version 1.0a1
?? December 1998


Release Notes


1 Compiler settings

The default compiler settings in larceny.heap are (fast-safe-code),
(benchmark-mode #f).  Thus, the programmer promises not to redefine
primitive procedures; effectively, any procedure listed in the Report or
in the IEEE Standard is off-limits.  The exact list of reserved names
is defined in the file Compiler/sparc.imp.sch.

The programmer can allow primitives to be redefined by calling
(standard-code); usually this results in a loss of performance.
