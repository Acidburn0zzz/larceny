#
#  These are the directories that are considered to be part of the Larceny
#  development environment.  Everyone who is working on the project has
#  their own copy of these directories, and uses RCS to populate the
#  directories with the Larceny sources.  Other directories and files
#  probably exist in each persons tree, but they are not part of the
#  project unless they are listed here or are in the RCS directories.
#
#  This file is read by:

#  To read this file into a sh variable, skipping lines starting with 
#  a '#' and ignoring blank lines, do this:
#
#  #!/bin/sh
#  dirs=`awk '!/^#/ {print}' < Directories`
