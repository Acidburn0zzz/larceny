This directory contains a crude infrastructure for running benchmarks.
It is an extensively hacked-up version of an infrastructure written by
Marc Feeley.

Files and directories:

    bench           ; a shell script that runs benchmarks
    summarize.sch   ; Scheme code for summarizing results
    src             ; source code of benchmarks
    prefix          ; implementation-specific prefix files
    suffix          ; implementation-specific suffix files
    results.*       ; outputs of the bench script
    Results         ; a place to move results.* files

With no arguments, the bench script will explain its usage.

To summarize results:

    % larceny
    > (load "summarize.sch")
    > ((summarize larceny-results) "results.Larceny")
    > ((summarize mzscheme-results) "results.MzScheme")

An output file can be specified as an optional argument.

Known bugs:

The benchmarks and numbers of iterations need to be rescaled
for current hardware.

The *-results procedures in summarize.sch are not complete.

MIT Scheme and Scheme 48 need more work.  Some of the others
may also need work.
