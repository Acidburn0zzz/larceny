This directory contains a set of Scheme benchmarks, including some of
the Gabriel benchmarks and a few larger benchmarks.

The "bench" script can be used to run a set of benchmarks or a single
benchmark.  Documentation for this script is available by executing
"bench" with no argument.

As a simple example, executing

  bench gambit-int "fib tak"

will run the benchmarks "fib" and "tak" using the Gambit-C
interpreter.  The results are sent to standard output and to
"results.Gambit-C-int".  A summary of the results is obtained
by executing

  summarize results.Gambit-C-int

The "bench" script assumes that the Gambit-C system has been installed
cleanly.
