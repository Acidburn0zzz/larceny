.SH NAME
larceny \- IEEE/ANSI/R4RS Scheme System for Sun4
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B larceny 
[ options ] heapfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Larceny accepts zero or more options are a heap image file. It reads the
heap image into memory and transfers control to the startup procedure in
the heap image, which in an interactive setting is the Scheme REP-loop.
However, users can dump heaps which have other start-up procedures,
thereby creating stand-alone applications.
