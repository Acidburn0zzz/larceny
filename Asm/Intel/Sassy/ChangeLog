2006-03-15 19:08:53 GMT	Jonathan Kraut <jak76@columbia.edu>	patch-30

    Summary:
      More docs (labels and locals), language cleanup
    Revision:
      sassy--mainline--0.2--patch-30

    Altered the overall syntax of (heap ...) to be consistent with text/data in terms of (begin ...), empty labels, nesting.
    
    Added error checks for re-defining symbols. No symbol can be defined twice in the same scope.
    
    Changed (direcs ...) to (begin ...), for uniformity in the language.
    
    Indirectly fixed (reloc ...) under 16-bit, by adding error checks to number->byte-list to make sure numbers can fit in a field size. This needed to happen anyway, so...
    
    For now I've bumped doing math on addresses off the 0.2 list, to be handled later.


2006-03-14 20:27:33 GMT	Jonathan Kraut <jak76@columbia.edu>	patch-29

    Full tests for the 16-bit instruction set, as listed in vol 3 of the intel manuals.
    
    Full tests for 16-bit versions of the sassy control flow primitives.
    
    Hooray!

    clarified documentation for jumps
    


2006-03-13 01:28:36 GMT	Jonathan Kraut <jak76@columbia.edu>	patch-26

    Summary:
      Corrected syntax of segment overrides, and added branch hints.
    Revision:
      sassy--mainline--0.2--patch-26

    (mov (cs (& eax)) 3)
    
    That is the override is wrapped around the memory addressing operand.
    
    Also added Pete Keller's macros cs: ds: etc.:
    
    (mov (cs: eax) 3) => (mov (cs (& eax)) 3)
    
    Finally, added branch hinting prefixes. They are:
    
    brt for branch taken
    brnt for branch not taken
    
    They are wrapped around any jcc instruction.
    
    (brt (jnz foo))
    
    Update docs and added tests (but the tests "seg" and "brt" are currently not generate-able with the generate-nasm.scm file, because it doesn't understand this new syntax.
    


2006-03-07 16:23:31 GMT	Jonathan Kraut <jak76@columbia.edu>	patch-25

    Summary:
      changes to docs from Pete Keller.
    Revision:
      sassy--mainline--0.2--patch-25



2006-03-02 23:24:31 GMT	Jonathan Kraut <jak76@columbia.edu>	patch-24

    Summary:
      robustified sassy-make-bin, default short immediates
    Revision:
      sassy--mainline--0.2--patch-24

    Also, made sassy-make-bin's reloc handling more robust, in terms of anonymous relocations.
    
    Changed the default immediate size to be a byte, instead of a dword, for the following instructions:
    
    adc add and cmp or sbb sub xor 
    push
    imul
    
    That means if an immediate is a second operand, and it is an unardorned byte, the version of the instruction that uses a byte, rather than a dword will be generated.
    
    eg:
    
    (xor eax 5) => #x83f005
    (xor eax (dword 5)) => #x3505000000
    
    Updated several tests to account for the new immediate handling.
