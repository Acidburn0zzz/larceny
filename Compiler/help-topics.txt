"(compile-file <schemefile>)
(compile-file <schemefile> <outputfile>)
  Compile the Scheme source file and produce a .fasl file.

(compile313 <schemefile> &opt <outputfile>)
  Compile the Scheme source file and produce a .lap file.

(assemble313 <lapfile> &opt <outputfile>)

(compiler-switches
"  compiler-switches  Info about a slew of compiler switches."

"
The command (compiler-switches) lists the current settings of all compiler
and assembler switches.  These switches are:

Debugging:
  issue-warnings             Display warning messages.
  include-procedure-names    Compiled code will contain the procedure name.
  include-variable-names     Compiled code will contain variable names.
  include-source-code        Compiled code will contain source code.
  single-stepping            Insert singlestepping support code.

Safety:
  avoid-space-leaks          Generate code to clear stale registers.
  write-barrier              Generate code for generational GC.
  runtime-safety-checking    Check for illegal arguments and other errors.
    catch-undefined-globals  Check references to global variables.

Speed:
  integrate-usual-procedures Generate in-line code for primitive procedures.
  control-optimization       Improve code for IF, AND, OR, COND, CASE.
  parallel-assignment-optimization    Choose a good order of evaluation.
  lambda-optimization        Improve code for known local procedures.
  benchmark-mode             Assume that self-recursive global procedures
                             will not be redefined.
  benchmark-block-mode       Assume that variables will not be assigned
                             outside of the file in which they are defined.
  global-optimization        Perform a flow analysis to support:
    interprocedural-inlining                of small known local procedures.
    interprocedural-constant-propagation    and constant folding.
    common-subexpression-elimination        of redundant expressions.
    representation-inference                to suppress redundant checking.
  local-optimization         Eliminate branches to branches and locally
                             redundant machine instructions.
  peephole-optimization      Improve common sequences of machine code.
  fill-delay-slots           Fill SPARC branch delay slots.
  inline-allocation          Generate in-line code for CONS, et cetera.

Internal (development) switches:
  listify?                   Produce listing of MAL code.  (NOTE: a variable)
")
((brief full)
"
The command (compiler-switches <flag>) sets groups of switches depending
on the value of the symbol <flag>.  The flags are:
  slow          Turn off all optimizations.
  standard      Enable all semantics-preserving optimizations.
  fast-safe     Enable all optimizations (except benchmark-block-mode)
                but generate code to perform all run-time type and range
                checks that are needed for safety.
  fast-unsafe   Enable all optimizations (except benchmark-block-mode)
                and disable type and range checking.
  default       Set switches to their default (factory) settings.

All switches can be set to #t to enable the effect explained above, or to
#f to disable the effect.  If the switch is a variable, its value can be 
set by an assignment.  If the switch is a procedure, it can be set by
passing an argument as in (benchmark-mode #f).

(disassembling
"  disassembling      Disassembling compiled code."
((brief full)
"(disassemble <procedure>)
  Disassemble the code vector of the procedure, printing the instructions
  to the current output port.

(disassemble-file <inputfile>)
(disassemble-file <inputfile> <outputfile>)
  Disassemble all code and constant vectors of the <inputfile>, which
  must be a .fasl or .lop format file, and print the disassembly listing
  on the current output port or to the given <outputfile>.

(general
"  general            General information about file types etc."
((brief full)
"Scheme source files have extension .sch or .scm; these extensions
are treated specially by the compiler. You may compile source files
with extensions other than these, but the compiler will not replace
them with an object file extension, only append the object file
extension to the file name.

Compiled files in tokenized form have extension .lap, for \"Lisp
Assembly Program\". Again, you can use others at the risk of having
to type a lot.

MacScheme assembly language files in symbolic form have extension
.mal (for \"MacScheme Assembly Language\").

Assembled files containing machine code segments have extension
.lop (for \"Lisp Object Program\").

Fast-load files containing machine code have extension .fasl, for
\"Fast-Load\". These files contains special syntax which allow
them to be read by Larceny's reader like any other file; there is
no magic about the extension.

Heap files usually have the extension .heap.

(heaps
"  heaps              Dumping heap images."
((full)
"A bootstrap heap image is created with the dump-heap procedure:

  (build-heap-image <heapname> <object-file-list>)

This creates a bootstrap heap image containing all the given objects.
However, it is not usually called directly; the following procedure
is typically more convenient:

  (make-sparc-heap)
    Create a bootstrap heap image for generational collectors,
    using the default makefile. The heap is named \"sparc.heap\".

Beware that neither of these commands cleans up .lop files compiled
for a different collector type; you should first 'make lopclean' from
the Unix shell if you are building a heap of a kind different from
the one you built last.  And if you have changed compiler switches,
you should 'make libclean' from the Unix shell to remove both LAP and
LOP files.

For details, see the file Lib/makefile.sch.
