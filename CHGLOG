----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.27  Not yet released


FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

Development environment
* [Chez/compat.sch] Now has a procedure chez-compile-files that compiles
  all the scheme files in the development environment to Chez object files,
  and now loads object files automatically if they exist and are newer than
  corresponding Scheme files.  See manual.

Evaluator
* [Eval/macro-expand.sch] (COND ((E) => E) ...) expansion is implemented.


BUG FIXES

Evaluator
* [Eval/macro-expand.sch] OR expansion is now correct.
* [Eval/macro-expand.sch] (COND ((E)) ...) expansion is now correct.
* [Eval/macro-expand.sch] Named LET expansion is now correct.


STRUCTURAL CHANGES

Cleanup
* [nbuild] Now gets nbuild.sch from Util rather than from Compiler.
* [Rts/config] Now gets config.sch from ../Util rather than from ../Compiler.
* [Util/nbuild.sch] Moved here from Compiler.
* [Util/config.sch] Moved here from Compiler.
* [Makefile] realclean should now really clean up
* [Rts/Makefile] distinguishes rtsclean and realclean.
* [Eval/macro-expand.sch] This file is the old Compiler/rewrite.sch.

Development environment
* [Util/nbuild.sch] Now parcels out the load work to compat:load.


MISC CHANGES

RTS
* [Rts/Sys/larceny.c] Now prints GC type only if -stats option is given.

Evaluator
* [Eval/eval.sch; Eval/toplevel.sch] 'Eval' now calls 'macro-expand' 
  rather than 'rewrite'.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.26  Created February 11, 1997 by lth

Noteworthy
* This version contains major changes from previous versions.
* Most compiled code continues to work, although old heap images do 
  not work, due to changes in the basic library.  Also, old code that
  relies on the interface to the 'collect' procedure or on the return
  value of the 'memstats' procedure will no longer work.
* Heap dumping is currently _not_ possible.

Major changes
* [RTS] Entirely new memory management subsystem.
* [RTS] Entirely new heap statistics code.
* [RTS] Full use of ANSI C prototypes throughout; system no longer compiles
  with the SunOS bundled C compiler ('cc').

Minor changes
* New GC and statistics interface from Scheme; see manual.
* New command line switches; see manual.
* [Lib/memstats.sch] Completely rewritten.
* [Lib/load.sch] No longer performs a GC after loading.
* [Lib/reader.sch] Flushes the icache when loading code vectors.
* [Lib/print.sch] The unprintable object is now #!unspecified.
* [Repl/reploop.sch] The REPL does not print #!unspecified.
* Text subdirectory is no longer part of the standard distribution

... and lots of others, I'm sure -- I lost track of them all.

v0.25b Created October 16, 1996 by lth

Bugs
- [Makefile] README was not included in the tar file
- [Makefile] Chez/compat.sch was not included in the tar file

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.25a Created September 1996 by lth

General reorganization, cleanup, and so on.
- [Compiler/dumpheap.sch] Now much faster, requires much less memory, but
  depends on the Chez system() procedure.  No big loss; the benefits are
  real.
- [Eval/toplevel.sch;Repl/reploop.sch] The procedure 'rep-loop' is no
  longer visible in the dumped heap.  Instead there exists an abstraction
  'dump-interactive-heap' which dumps a heap with the standard reploop
  as the startup procedure (init file loading and all).
- [./nbuild; Compiler/nbuild.sch; Chez/compat.sch; Larceny/compat.sch]
  The nbuild script can now be used to run the development environment
  under both Chez and Larceny and should generalize to other systems
  as well.  Compiler/nbuild.sch is now system-independent.
- [misc] Assembler switches have been cleaned up:
  - 'Register-transactions-for-side-effects' is now a switch procedure 
    called 'write-barrier', defaults to #t.
  - 'Inline-cons' is now a switch procedure, default #f.
  - 'Inline-assignment' is now a switch procedure, default #f.
  - 'emit-undef-check?' is now a switch procedure called 
    'catch-undefined-globals', default #t.
  - 'unsafe-mode' is now a switch procedure called 'unsafe-code',
    default #f.
- [misc] The heap dumper switch 'generate-global-symbols?' is now
  a switch procedure called 'generate-global-symbols' defaulting to #t.
- [Repl; Repl/reploop.sch] Realizing that the repl is independent of
  both the evaluator and the library, a new subdirectory Repl holds
  all the common repl and user interface code.
- [Lib/load.sch; Lib/makefile.sch] Lib/load.sch is new; it contains the 
  loader.
- [Eval; Lib/makefile.sch; nbuild] Lib/Eval is now called Eval, on
  the top level. Changes to the makefile and nbuild to accomodate this.
- [Lib/*; Lib/makefile.sch] Files renamed and removed; all file names now 
  fit an 8+3 format for transportability to DOS.
- [Lib/*; Lib/makefile.sch] Library.sch discontinued; created list.sch,
  vector.sch, control.sch. Moved many things from preds.sch to other
  files.
- [Auxlib] Created the directory Auxlib to hold 'add-on' libraries; see
  the section for features below.
- [Test] Created the directory Test to hold distributed test files (like
  regression tests).
- [Benchmarks] Created the directory Benchmarks to hold standard benchmark
  program, for testing and benchmarking. Programs in the Test suite may
  rely on these being present.

Bug fixes in library.
- [Lib/bignums.sch] fixnum->bignum did not handle most negative fixnum.
- [Lib/load.sch] Now performs a gc after a load to flush the icache.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Rts/Sys/unix.sch; Rts/Sys/cglue.c] Output ports 
  now handle legal situations where the write system call does not write 
  all bytes at once correctly; implemented new procedure sys$write-file4
  which takes additional argument which is offset into buffer.
- [Lib/primops.sch] make-vector required the fill argument, which is wrong.
- [Lib/unix.sch; Repl/reploop.sch] **newline** has been moved to unix.sch
  (because it is OS-dependent) and is set to 10, formerly 13.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch] A bad test for eof in peek-char was corrected.
- [Lib/num2str.sch] Now does compnums.
- [Lib/flonums.sch] Make-compnum used wrong indices into flonums and compnum 
  when copying.
- [Lib/mcode.sch] generic-make-rectangular was too simplistic and crashed
  when it called make-compnum with an exact number.
- [Lib/bignums.sch] Tuned bignum-ref, bignum-set!, for considerable speedup
  on em benchmark.
- [Lib/contag.sch] Tuned contagion somewhat by avoiding some consing and
  doing CPS instead.
- [Lib/makefile.sch] Now turns off generation checking before starting
  make-larceny-eheap, and turned it on before starting make-larceny-heap.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch] Cleaned up many error messages.
- [Lib/ratnums.sch] Fixed the implementations of round and truncate,
  which were (very) incorrect. This also fixes rationalize.
- [Lib/reader.sch] Fixed bug in 'read' where it would always read from
  the terminal when not given a port argument, regardless of what the
  current input port was.

Bug fixes/changes in Sparc assembler.
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Fixed implementation of lognot, which 
  had arguments reversed to a machine instruction (ornr is not commutative).
- [Sparcasm/asmutil.sch] This file is new. It contains helpful definitions
  common to the assembler modules.
- [Sparcasm/switches.sch] This file is new. It contains definitions of all
  the switches used by the Sparc assembler.
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Fixed bug in emit-single-tagcheck-assert-reg! 
  which caused error-causing value not to be passed to error handler if
  it was not already in RESULT (as is often the case with optimized code).
  Fixed ditto bugs in emit-assert-fixnum! and emit-assert-positive-fixnum!.

Bug fixes in run-time system
- [Lib/generic.s] Unary minus (m_generic_neg) was wrong for the most
  negative fixnum, a case which causes overflow in the in-line code and
  which must therefore be handled specially.
- [Rts/Sys/gc.c] The collector now zeroes all pad words; this simplifies
  the heap dumper quite a bit and should simplify other tools (hsplit)
  which work on heap images which have been through the collector at least
  once.
- [Rts/Sys/gc.c, Rts/Sys/policy.c] Heap overflow limit was incorrectly
  calculated during full garbage collection, causing segmentation faults
  under certain heap-full conditions.
- [Lib/generic.s] Obscure overflow cases in =, <, <=, >, >= were fixed.
  Happened when the difference of the operands overflowed, e.g. when a
  is a small negative number and b is a positive number close to the 
  fixnum limit (specific case -32 and 2^29-1).
- [Lib/generic.s] Real-part and imag-part were very wrong.

Bug fixes in compiler.
- [Compiler/switches.sch] Added issue-warnings, used by the macro expander
  and previously defined in Lib/Eval/reploop.sch. On the other hand, this
  seems to be global in MacScheme?

Bug fixes in development system.
- [nbuild] Nbuild did not actually detect whether schdefs.h needed to be
  updated.

Features
- [Lib/reader.sch,Lib/control.sch,Lib/load.sch,Eval/eval.sch] Implemented 
  and used global-name-resolver for dealing with name lookup in global
  environments.
- [Lib/env.sch] Placeholders for R5RS environments.
- [Lib/control.sch] Implemented dynamic-wind.
- [Rts/Sys/policy.c,memstats.c] -memstats argument now causes static
  area size to be printed.
- [Lib/str2num.sch;Lib/num2str.sch] There is now read and print syntax
  for infinite flonums (+inf.0 and -inf.0) and NANs (+nan.0 and -nan.0,
  although these are the same number) and their usual complex combinations.
  The syntax is consistent with Chez Scheme; it was needed in order for
  Larceny to support its own development, as there are literal infinite
  numbers and NANs in the object files.
- [misc] There is now a distinguished eof-object, and it is returned by
  a call to the integrable 'eof-object'.
- [Repl/reploop.sch] If command line arguments are present, then the first
  one is interpreted as a file name and attempted loaded if the file exists.
  The others are ignored.  This change makes Larceny usable with nbuild.
- [Rts/Sys/larceny.c, argv.c; Compiler/dumpheap.sch; Lib/go.sch; 
   Repl/reploop.sch] The startup procedure now gets passed a vector
   containing the command line strings following the -args argument
   (which is new).  This way, the program can access the command line.
- [Rts/Sparc/mcode.s, Lib/error.sch] Implemented timer interrupt.
- [misc] Distinguishes #!unspecified and #!undefined; globals now initialized
  as #!undefined.
- [Rts/Sparc/generic.s; Lib/ehandler.sch] Now checks for division by 
  zero (albeit the hard way).
- [Rts/Sys/heapio.sch] Now dumps split heaps.
- [Lib/str2num.sch] Now supports complex numbers.
- [Lib/num2str.sch] Now supports compnums.
- [Lib/mcode.sch] Millicode table now has two-argument versions of common
  multi-argument procedures (+,-, and so on) allowing them not to cons
  up varargs.
- [Lib/number.sch] Tuned floor and ceiling by special-casing flonums,
  avoiding mixed-representation arithmetic.
- [Compiler;Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch;Lib/{number.sch,flonums.sch}] Made flonum?
  a primop.
- [Lib/unix.sch,number.sch;Rts/Sys/unix.c,cglue.c] Added log, exp, sin, cos,
  tan, asin, acos, atan, sqrt (although not for complexes yet).
- [Compiler/nmake.sch;Lib/nmkfile.sch] This is a new make system and
  associated make file much improved. The files Lib/makefile.sch and
  Compiler/make.sch are obsolete and will be removed in a future release.
- [Lib/error.sch; Lib/ehandler.sch; Repl/reploop.sch] There is now a
  procedure reset which is more basic than error. There is also support
  for installable error and reset handlers with the error-handler and
  reset-handler procedures. There is a new file Lib/error.sch.
- [Compiler/compile313.sch] Object files compiled without write barrier 
  checks now have extension .elop, to match the .eheap heap files. This
  makes it possible to build both types of heaps at the same time. It
  also reduces the opportunity for error. [Still to FIX: Should have fasl
  and efasl.]
- [Rts/Sparc/cache.c;Rts/Sparc/cache0.s;Rts/Sys/gc.c] Larceny now detects
  automatically whether the icache needs to be flushed or not.
- [Auxlib/auxload.sch] This file will load all the auxiliary library
  files.
- [Auxlib/sort.sch] Added sort procedures for lists and vectors (based on
  the permsort code).
- [Auxlib/pp.sch] Added Marc Feeley's pretty printer (from the Scheme
  repository).
- [Auxlib/misc.sch] Added several useful procedures: some?, every?.
- [Rts/Sys/hsplit.c; ~/hsplit] Created standalone program 'hsplit' to 
  split heaps into a static and a dynamic area.

v0.24 created August 1, 1995 by lth

NOTE: COMPILED FILES FROM EARLIER VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER COMPATIBLE.

Bug fixes in the compiler
- [twobit.imp.sch] removed define-inline of undefined and unspecified,
  because they are wrong (and interfere with global-var-checking). One
  day we need to get this right. However, this may have had an adverse
  effect on code generation: there seems to be more SAVEing going on
  than previously.
- [pass4p2.sch] a call to cgframe-newtemp with two arguments (in the
  procedure cg-evalargs) where the second argument was 1 was changed
  to a call to cgframe-newtemp with the second argument removed.
- [Compiler/twobit.imp.sch; Lib/integrable-procs] 'Undefined' is now
  a bona fide primop.
- [Compiler/pass1.aux.sch] Uses %make-promise rather than make-promise
  for the expansion of 'delay'.

Bug fixes in the RTS and Libraries
- [Rts/Sys/memstats.c; others] Statistics are now updated when collected
  by the user program, rather than only at GC time.
- [Lib/unix.sch] Sys$gc is now a procedure (a syscall) rather than a primop.
- [Lib/ratnums.sch] Lots of bugs fixed.
- [Lib/print.sch] Swapped the order of port and eof-object because an
  eof-object is also a port (in the current implementation).
- [Lib/millicode-support.sch] Quotient, remainder should now work with
  non-exact integers.
- [Lib/number.sch] floor and ceiling now work.
- [Rts/Sparc/generic.s; Lib/number.sch; Lib/integrable-procs.sch; 
   Compiler/twobit.imp.sch; Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Modulo is no longer
   a primop, and should now work.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Lib/print.sch] Port is not printed with direction
  and file name.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Lib/unix.sch] Moved all OS-dependencies in the I/O
  system into the Unix-specific file.
- [Rts/Sparc/mcode.s; Sparcasm/gen-primop.sch; Compiler/twobit.imp.sch;
   Lib/integrable-procs.sch; Lib/strings.sch] Implemented new millicode 
   subroutine m_bvlcmp (aka sys$bvlcmp) for comparing bytevector-like 
   structures lexicographically. Wrote it in assembly language because
   the context switch time would dominate for most arguments.
- [Rts/Sparc/unix.s] Superseded by syscall. File moved to Rts/Sparc/Old.
- [Lib/malcode.mal] New file for all MAL in the system. Notably, contains
  code for call-with-current-continuation and syscall.
- [Lib/xlib.sch] Code for call-with-current-continuation is no longer here.
- [Lib/rawapply.mal, Lib/unixio.mal] merged into Lib/malcode.mal; files
  moved to Lib/Old.
- [Rts/Sys/policy.c] code for expand_tspace did not take into account
  data in the overflow area, resulting in a memory overrun and a 
  segmentation fault.
- [Rts/Sparc/glue.s] code for copyregs saved only the first 16 registers,
  causing the garbage collector to crash (and probably also other bugs,
  but the programs usually did not get that far).
- [Lib/preds.sch] memq actually used eqv? for comparison.
- [Compiler/config.sch; Rts/config] Changes to accomodate Solaris;
  some odds and ends were not properly ported for 0.23.
- [Lib/bignums.sch] Many, many changes in bignum code to make it work.
- [Lib/flonum-stuff.sch] Several changes in flonum code to make it work.
- [Lib/ratnums.sch] Changed make-reduced-ratnum, which did not deal with
  cases where the reduced number was x/1.
- [Rts/Sparc/generic.s] Fixed two bugs where the length of flonum and compnum
  structures were incorrectly set to 4 bytes larger than actual length.
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Fixed bug in exception handling code for character 
  comparisons: the second operand would not be passed to the handler correctly.
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Fixed bug where the wrong exception code was passed
  for bytevector-like-set!.
- [Lib/preds.sch] [Will] Added list-tail, list-ref.
- [Lib/preds.sch] Added IEEE compliant list?, and last-pair.
- [Rts/Sys/cglue.c; Rts/Sparc/glue.s] Fixed bug in C_exception(): it did not 
  pass the correct number of arguments to the print routine, resulting in 
  bogus error messages. It also did not receive more than one argument from 
  the millicode handler, but now receives two (code and pc).
- [Lib/ratnums.sch; Lib/millicode-support-vector.sch; Rts/Sparc/generic.s] 
  Added ratnum-round, ratnum-truncate; generic.s now has code which handles
  round and truncate for ratnums.
- [Rts/Sys/ldebug.c] Now possible to name RESULT, ARGREG2, ARGREG3 in the 
  RTS debugger.
- [Compiler/compile313.sch] Fixed error where assemble313 would assign
  ".mal" as the extension of the output if the output name was not
  explicitly given (should be ".lop"). Error was probably introduced during
  cleanup for v0.23, as it used to work.
- [Various] Added definitions for %LIST, %LIST->VECTOR, %CONS, and %APPEND 
  to the libraries to support the macro expander.
- [Chez/misc2bytevector.ss] Fixed the definition of +/- infinity; the old
  bit patterns actually represented NANs.

Features
- [Lib/number.sch; Lib/Eval/eval.sch] Added 'rationalize' (from MacScheme).
- [Sparcasm/gen-msi.sch] INVOKE and ARGS= now affected by unsafe-mode.
- [Lib/Eval/reploop.sch] Now loads .larceny or ~/.larceny if possible.
- [Compiler/nbuild.sch; Chez/values.ss] Now handles both Chez 5.0 and 4.1.
- [Lib/strings.sch] Implemented bytevector-like-equal?; general cleanup.
- [Compiler/pass1.aux.sch; Lib/library.sch] delay now uses the 'hidden'
  definition %make-promise; also implemented this (and force).
- [Lib/library.sch; Lib/strings.sch; Lib/Eval/eval.sch] Added definitions
  of string-fill! and vector-fill!.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Lib/unix.sch; Rts/Sys/cglue.c; Rts/Sys/unix.c; 
   Lib/Eval/eval.sch]
  Implemented hooks for char-ready?, file-modification-time, file-exists?,
  rename-file, and getenv. Then implemented those procedures.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Lib/unix.sch] 'exit' now flushes open files.
- [Lib/schemeio.sch; Lib/Eval/eval.sch] with-input-from-file, 
  with-output-to-file, and reset-iosystem implemented and made public.
- [Lib/preds.sch] added append!, reverse!.
- [Lib/Eval/eval.sch] added string-hash, symbol-hash to environment.
- [Lib/xlib.sch;Lib/Eval/eval.sch] updated print-continuation; 'error' now
  stores the raw continuation in a global variable for inspection. The
  raw continuation (a vector structure) can be accessed with the procedure
  'error-continuation'.
- [Compiler/*] [Will] New compiler. Note, in particular, changes to
  the assembler [assembler.sch] to accomodate new SAVE in a reasonable
  way.
- [Rts/Sparc/generic.s] quotient and remainder now handle 
  32-bit-nonnegative-bignum by nonnegative-fixnum case in millicode; this 
  to better support the portable bignum code.
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] Character comparison predicates now take into 
  account unsafe-mode.
- [Compiler/peepopt.sch; Compiler/assembler.sch; Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch]
  Implemented optimization of boolean expressions for control in expressions
  involving character predicates.
- [Compiler/peepopt.sch; Compiler/assembler.sch; Sparcasm/gen-msi.sch;
   Compiler/twobit.imp.sch]
  Implemented peephole optimization of reg n ; branchf L when n is a
  hardware register (no payoff when it is not).
- [Lib/Eval/eval.sch] Added predicates for testing number representation to 
  top-level environment in evaluator.
- [Lib/makefile.sch; Lib/bellerophon.sch] Added bellerophon to the default
  heap image and shuffled the load order a little to make this work. 
  Bellerophon does not presently call slow-ten-to-e during initialization; 
  those values are precomputed for acceptable load-time performance. This 
  should be ok.
- [Rts/Sparc/glue.s; Rts/Sys/cglue.c] Added syscall primitive. Rewrote
  a number of procedures (I/O, exit, resource-usage) to use syscall instead.

Various changes
- [Sparcasm/gen-prim.sch] internal changes to clean it up.
- [Lib/Eval/eval.sch] [Will] Cleanup of the toplevel environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.23 created March 7, 1995 by lth

- Implemented instruction cache flush code.
- Basic support for new SAVE instruction (one-arg) in assembler.
- Inline generation-check for setcar/setcdr implemented in assembler.
- Larceny now compiles and runs under Solaris as well.
- New directory structure.
- New Makefiles.
- Fixed sundry bugs in command line parsing.
- Cleaned up some of the Chez development system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.22 created August 20, 1994 by lth

Speeded up stack underflow by recoding restore_frame directly in the
underflow handler, saving two full context switches on every frame restore.
On code like the deeply recursive append there is a nice speedup (esp. on
owyhee, for some reason, less on the ELC) in the range 15-50%, so it
is worth it for code like that; the handler gets pretty big though, so
there's extra complexity to deal with.

Whether this affects the performance of "real" programs is unknown. It
was more ment as an experiment to see how fast stack handling can go.
It can't go much faster than this...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.21 created July 29, 1994 by lth

Speeded up the garbage collector by redesigning scan() and by removing
a level of indirection in forw(). Nice payoff, ~8% on Boyer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.20 created July 19, 1994 by lth.

Major rewrite of run-time system.

Major changes to Compiler/compile313: much cleaned up. make-fasl is now
a part of this file, which contains all drivers.

Make-fasl moved out of Compiler/makefasl.sch; there is now only one
procedure, dump-fasl-segment-to-port, in this file.

; eof
